            <h2>Playing Instruments</h2>
            <p>I enjoy playing various musical instruments, including the Dongxiao(Chinese Traditional Music) and Clarinet. Music is a great way for me to relax and express my creativity.</p>

            <h2>Meditation</h2>
            <p>Meditation is an essential part of my daily routine, and I learned it from Buddhism. It helps me stay focused, calm, and grounded, especially during busy times.</p>

                <p>My Thoughts: "On the Road" is unique for its stream-of-consciousness prose, vivid portrayal of the Beat Generation, and its exploration of freedom and self-discovery. It captures the restless, rebellious spirit of post-WWII America, influencing literature and culture profoundly.</p>
