        <h2>Hello! Mr. Rush!</h2>
        <p>This is a simplified version of my request form. If you don't have the time to read the whole PDF file, please look at this summary.</p>

        <div class="request-form">
            <p><b>Letter of Recommendation Request Form for Class of 2024</b></p>

            <p1>1. What was your most memorable class-related experience with this teacher?</p1>
            <p>Discussing "Poor Economics" with Mr. Rush was my most memorable experience. Before winter vacation, I approached Mr. Rush after reading "Poor Economics" and expressed my desire to discuss the book. He graciously agreed and spent an evening reading it to discuss with me the following day. His dedication and the substance of our conversation impressed me deeply. This discussion deepened my interest in economics and reinforced my commitment to studying the subject.</p>

            <p1>2. Give an example of an experience from this class where you worked as part of a team and your efforts contributed to a positive classroom environment.</p1>
            <p>Helping my friend Jason with Macroeconomics content created a positive classroom environment. Jason initially struggled and felt anxious, so he sought my help. I assisted him in reviewing the material, which also served as a review for myself. This dynamic of teaching and learning not only helped Jason but also improved the overall class atmosphere.</p>

            <p1>3. Describe an occasion during this class when you demonstrated your creativity or problem-solving skills.</p1>
            <p>Initially, I relied solely on memorizing factors that would shift curves, which led to poor performance. After seeking advice from Mr. Rush, I changed my approach to learning by drawing conclusions using my own logic. This shift helped me improve significantly, demonstrating my problem-solving skills.</p>

            <p1>4. For this class, how well did you cope with academic demands? </p1>
            <p>Initially, I found it difficult to complete assignments on time. However, I made significant progress and now complete all assignments efficiently. My curiosity and openness to new things helped me adapt to the class style and enjoy the learning process.</p>

            <p1>5. Think of an assignment or a project that you undertook for this class that caused you to become curious about a new topic. </p1>
            <p>The concepts of opportunity cost and sunk cost sparked my interest in practical applications of economics. Reading "Poor Economics" and discussing it with Mr. Rush reinforced my decision to major in Economics, emphasizing the humanistic concerns and real-life applications of the subject.</p>

            <p1>6. What are some qualities desired by your intended major at a university? How do you feel that you have developed in these qualities while enrolled in this course? Identify three adjectives that describe you. Which quality might distinguish you most from your peers? For each adjective, briefly elaborate with supporting evidence of the trait.</p1>
            <p>I participated in the Pioneer program for Economic Growth, took part in competitions like LIBF and IEO, and read non-textbooks such as "Money, Banking, and Financial Systems." These activities provided foundational knowledge for my major.</p>

            <p1>7. What are some qualities desired by your intended major at a university? How have you developed these qualities in this course?</p1>
            <p>The desired qualities include interdisciplinary thinking, leadership, passion, and math proficiency. Through various extracurricular activities and classroom experiences, I have developed these qualities, making me a strong candidate for my intended major.</p>

        <p2><strong>Thank you for reading through, Mr. Davis! If you need anything else, please tell me, and I will send it to you immediately. Again, thank you so much for being my recommendation letter teacher!</strong></p2>
