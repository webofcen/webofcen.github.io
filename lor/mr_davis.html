        <h2>Hello! Mr. Davis!</h2>
        <p>This is a simplified version of my request form. If you don't have the time to read the whole PDF file, please look at this summary.</p>

        <div class="request-form">
            <p><b>Letter of Recommendation Request Form for Class of 2024</b></p>

            <p1>1. Think of an assignment or a project that you undertook for this class that caused you to become curious about a new topic, one with which you were previously unfamiliar. Why did this topic excite you so much? What actions did you take to explore your curiosity about this topic?</p1>
            <p>The introduction of Jon Krakauer’s book "Into the Wild" initially seemed dull to me, but Mr. Davis's explanation captivated me with insightful extensions into American culture and historical context. This discussion piqued my interest in Chris McCandless’s pursuit of freedom and the broader societal implications. Consequently, I began exploring historical contexts and read Jack Kerouac's "On the Road," which deepened my passion for cultural themes in literature.</p>

            <p1>2. What was your most memorable class-related experience with this teacher? Please share memorable details of a personal interaction with the teacher. What are the most important insights you gained from this class?</p1>
            <p>Discussing "On the Road" with Mr. Davis was a transformative experience. He introduced me to the "beat" generation and post-World War II American culture, providing a deeper understanding of the historical and societal context. This session marked my initial attempt to fully comprehend a culturally rich book, fostering a new appreciation for English literature.</p>

            <p1>3. For this class, how well did you cope with academic demands? Did you complete your assignments efficiently and in a timely manner? What motivates you to be a resilient learner? Explain with an example.</p1>
            <p>Initially, I struggled to complete assignments efficiently, but I made significant progress over time. I now complete all assignments effectively. My curiosity and openness to new things, coupled with Mr. Davis's encouragement, have motivated me to adapt and thrive in this class.</p>

            <p1>4. Give an example of an experience from this class where you worked as part of a team and your efforts contributed to a positive classroom environment. What was the activity? How many students were involved? What was your role within this team? Did you have to overcome any challenges? What did you accomplish with this team?</p1>
            <p>Participating in group discussions and peer reviews with classmates fostered a collaborative learning environment. We worked together to solve complex problems, sharing ideas and perspectives. Despite occasional disagreements, our deep discussions led to a consensus and a deeper understanding of the material.</p>

            <p1>5. What research, project work, subject competitions, online courses, and/or additional readings did you initiate to extend and deepen your knowledge of this subject? How does this “extended learning” relate to your academic interests and intended major?</p1>
            <p>I explored books like "The Sun Also Rises" and "On the Road" to understand the cultural and economic contexts of their times. These explorations deepened my understanding of cultural phenomena and motivated me to consider Economics as a major, as it intersects with cultural and historical contexts.</p>

            <p1>6. What are some qualities desired by your intended major at a university? How do you feel that you have developed in these qualities while enrolled in this course? Identify three adjectives that describe you. Which quality might distinguish you most from your peers? For each adjective, briefly elaborate with supporting evidence of the trait.</p1>
            <p>The desired qualities include interdisciplinary thinking, leadership, passion, and math proficiency. AP English and Composition has expanded my knowledge across subjects, helping me apply economic concepts to cultural contexts. Group discussions and lectures have boosted my confidence and passion for reading. My extracurricular activities demonstrate my leadership and interdisciplinary interests.</p>
        </div>

        <p2><strong>Thank you for reading through, Mr. Davis! If you need anything else, please tell me, and I will send it to you immediately. Again, thank you so much for being my recommendation letter teacher!</strong></p2>
